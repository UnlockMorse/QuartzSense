# QuartzSense - AI Agent Framework

**QuartzSense** is an open-source framework for building customizable AI agents. It allows developers to create agents with distinct personalities, execute specific tasks, and integrate external services. Built on top of OpenAI's GPT models, QuartzSense empowers you to create intelligent agents for various use cases such as chatbots, virtual assistants, task automation, and social media integrations like Telegram and Discord.

## üß† **Concept**

QuartzSense is designed to simplify the creation of AI agents that can interact with users and perform specific functions. It provides a flexible environment to define agent personalities, set tasks, and define responses based on input. Powered by GPT models, QuartzSense allows you to build agents that are interactive, intelligent, and can adapt to different scenarios.

### **Core Principles**:
- **Custom Personalities**: You can define your agent‚Äôs personality, voice, and behavior to make it unique.
- **Task-based Interactions**: Agents can perform specific tasks like greetings, jokes, calculations, and more.
- **OpenAI GPT Integration**: Built on top of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models, making agents capable of understanding complex conversations and generating dynamic responses.
- **Social Media Integration**: Extend your agent's reach by integrating it with messaging platforms like **Telegram** and **Discord**.

## üåü **Features**

- **Customizable Agent Personalities**: Modify tone, behavior, and response style for personalized agents.
- **Task Management**: Define a list of tasks and have agents respond to specific user requests.
- **Multilingual Support**: Agents can interact with users in different languages.
- **API Integration**: Extend the functionality of your agents by connecting them to external services or APIs.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Simple JSON-based configuration allows for quick customization and updates.
- **Scalable Architecture**: The framework is designed to support a wide variety of agents, from basic ones to more complex, multi-functional agents.
- **Telegram Integration**: Create agents that can respond to messages on Telegram, send updates, and perform tasks within Telegram chats.
- **Discord Integration**: Build agents that interact with Discord users, send messages, and respond to commands in Discord servers.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **Telegram Agent**

The **Telegram Agent** functionality allows you to create an agent that interacts with users via Telegram. It can send and receive messages, respond to user commands, and integrate with Telegram bots for more interactive experiences.

### **Features**:
- Responds to messages sent to your Telegram bot.
- Can handle simple text messages and predefined commands (e.g., /hello, /joke).
- Supports interactive replies and tasks defined in your `config.json`.
- Customizable for specific Telegram groups or channels.

### **How It Works**:
1. **Create a Telegram Bot**: Set up a bot using the [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) on Telegram.
2. **Configure Telegram Integration**: Add your bot‚Äôs API token to the `telegram_config.json` file.
3. **Interact**: Once configured, your agent will start responding to messages in your Telegram bot, performing tasks like sending jokes, answering questions, and more.

## üí¨ **Discord Agent**

QuartzSense also provides **Discord Agent** functionality, enabling agents to interact with users in Discord servers. This integration allows your agent to listen for commands, send messages to channels, and respond to user queries within Discord.

### **Features**:
- Responds to commands and messages from Discord users.
- Supports interactive features like posting jokes, providing information, and handling specific server-based tasks.
- Can be invited to any Discord server with the correct permissions.
- Works well with both public and private channels.

### **How It Works**:
1. **Create a Discord Bot**: Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a new bot, and copy its token.
2. **Configure Discord Integration**: Add your bot‚Äôs token to the `discord_config.json` file.
3. **Invite Bot to Server**: Use the generated OAuth2 URL to invite your bot to a Discord server.
4. **Interact**: Your agent will begin responding to messages in Discord, whether it‚Äôs answering questions, handling commands, or providing information.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Architecture**

QuartzSense is structured to make building, customizing, and deploying AI agents easy:

1. **Agent Core**: The backbone of the framework, powered by OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models.
2. **Task Engine**: Manages the agent's responses and tasks, allowing it to handle predefined actions like sending greetings, jokes, etc.
3. **Social Media Integrations**: Provides easy-to-use configurations for integrating your agent with platforms like Telegram and Discord.
4. **Configuration Files**: `settings.json`, `telegram_config.json`, and `discord_config.json` control the agent‚Äôs behavior, personality, and platform-specific settings.
5. **Extensibility**: QuartzSense is designed to be easily extensible. You can add more tasks, integrate third-party APIs, and modify the agent's behavior as needed.
